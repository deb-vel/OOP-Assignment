This folder contains 2 .tar.gz folders as the programs where coded on linux therefore files were compressed on linux.

CplusPlusProgram.tar.gz contains the c++ program.  Inside it you will find the compile.sh and run.sh bash files.
JavaProgram.tar.gz contains the java program.  Inside the src file you will find the compile.sh and run.sh bash files.

For both programs the following commands are to be run in the terminal:
source ./compile.sh
source ./run.sh

Both programs contain their own text files that are required to read from while executing.

I also included a text files folder which contains text files with source code in case any of it is needed.
